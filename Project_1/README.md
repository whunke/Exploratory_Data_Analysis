## Exploratory Data Analysis
### Course Project 1

This repository contains all scripts necessary to generate the plots for Course Project 1.

To generate the plots, do the following:

 * Download the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip.
 * Download the scripts from this repository (plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R) to a local directory.  Ensure that these scripts are at the same folder level as the household_power_consumption.txt file downloaded in the first step.
 * Run each script to generate the associated .png plot file.
